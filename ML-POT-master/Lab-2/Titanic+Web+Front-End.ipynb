    "IBM Data Science Experience (DSX) is an interactive, collaborative, cloud-based environment where data scientists can use multiple tools to achieve insights.\n",
    "Data Scientists can use the best of open source, tap into IBM's unique features, grow their skills, and collaborate with teams.\n",
    "One of the many features of DSX provides the capability to create and train a machine learning model in DSX with little to no coding.\n",
    "This model can subsequently be saved and deployed to Watson Machine Learning on IBM Bluemix and called for scoring in real-time. \n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook will demonstrate how to create a web front end to invoke the Titanic scoring model developed in prior lab steps.  \n",

The following techniques can also be applied to other web app frameworks. For this tutorial, a boilerplate Python Flask web app will be created on Bluemix and the supporting files will be downloaded.  These files will be updated to integrate with your model and then pushed back up.\n",

    "1. Start by deploying a Python Flask boilerplate. Sign on to your **Bluemix** account and click **Catalog**. On the left hand side click **Boilerplates** and then click > **Python Flask**. \n",
    "2. In the **App name** field, enter a unique name for your application. This name identifies your application and will appear in the URL that users need to access the app.\n",
    "3. Click **Create**. Please give this some time to start.  The web app is running when there is a green dot next to the top title and it says **Running**.  To access this web app, click on the **Visit App URL** link.  The URL to access this Web application will be: `http://<your_app_name>.mybluemix.net` \n",
    "3. Download and unpack the command line interface and the starter code shown on this web page.  **Please spend some time on this page and become familiar with Cloud Foundry and Python Flask.** \n",
    "4. Now this boilerplate Python Flask Web application will be updated to call the deployed Titanic scoring model.  \n",
    "5. In the folder where the unpacked starter code is located, create a file called `Titanic.py` and copy the following Python code into that file. As before, update the `url`, `username`, `password`, and `scoring_endpoint` fields to match with your deployed model. You may need to set pasting options to preserve the indentations which are critical for the following Python code. When completed, save this file.
