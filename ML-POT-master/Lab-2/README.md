In this lab, you will use IBM's Data Science Experience (DSX) to create a Jupyter IPython notebook to examine the principles of Machine Learning using the Titanic dataset.   You will build a model based upon the actual Titanic disaster to predict who survived -- and who did not.

## Objectives:

Upon completing the lab, you will know how to:

1. Setup the environment for Watson Machine Learning
1. Adding a dataset to the project
1. Create a model to determine survivors
1. Deploy and test the model

## Instructions:

### Step 1.  Follow the instructions in the PDF file.
