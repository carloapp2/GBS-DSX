In this lab, you will use IBM's Data Science Experience (DSX) to create a Jupyter IPython notebook to examine the concepts of Principal Component Analysis in Machine Learning.   You will build a models based upon the matrix data an analyse their features.

## Objectives:

Upon completing the lab, you will know how to:

1. Create a Jupyter IPython notebook from a URL
1.

## Instructions:

### Step 1.  Log into your [DSX](http://datascience.ibm.com/) account, then select `View All Projects`, then select the project you created at the beginning of this proof of technology.

1. Click the `From URL` tab under `Create Notebook`.
1. Give the notebook a name in the `Name` field, for example `PCA` and optionally you can give it a description.
1. In the Notebook URL field, use `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jpatter/ML-POT/master/Lab-3/PCA-student.ipynb`.
1. Ensure that there is a `Spark Service` selected, then click the `Create Notebook` button on the bottom right of the screen.

### Step 4.  Follow the instructions in the notebook.
